# Kinopoisk_Analysis
Using the Mann-Whitney U test and Bootstrap, we examined the evolution of the differences between the top-250 ratings on Kinopoisk. The Mann-Whitney U test is non-parametric and appropriate for small samples, making it the ideal choice for our situation. And practically all sample sizes are compatible with Bootstrap. Only the ratings of USSR movies throughout time made statistical differences, which makes logical given the political climate.
